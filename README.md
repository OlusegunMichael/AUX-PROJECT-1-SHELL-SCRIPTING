# AUX-PROJECT-1-SHELL-SCRIPTING

In this project, A Shell script is created that reads a csv file that contains the names of the 20 new linux sers to be onboarde to be  onboarded onto a server.

This script would be able to do the following:
* [x] Read the CSV file and create each user on the server, and
* [x] Add users to an existing group called developers
* [x] The script will first check for the existence of the user on the system, before it will attempt to create.
* [x] The user would have a default home folder
* [x] Each user would have a .ssh folder within its HOME folder.
* [x] For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, create an authorized_keys file and add the public key of your current user.
